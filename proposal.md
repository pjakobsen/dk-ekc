Title page

Introduction. 1 paragraph composed of :
First: 1 or 2 sentences that introduce the topic in a general way. 
Second: 1 or 2 sentences that present the topic or research question in a precise manner. A clear statement of the problem that you will examine. 
(These 2-4 sentences in fact have the goal of explaining clearly why you think the problem you have chosen is important and worth exploring.) 
Third: 1 sentence: «In what follows section 1 will present a literature review, section 2 will provide our model, the hypotheses we intend to test and the proposed estimation procedure, section 3 will present and discuss our data sources.” 

Section 1 Review of the literature. 

This is written after you have read and analyzed 10 articles some mainly theoretical others mainly empirical. 
For some topics all 10 articles will be partly theoretical and partly empirical. 
This section does not consist of 10 individual paragraphs, one per article without any links between them. 
Instead, it is a presentation of the main ideas coming out of your readings, each of which is likely to have been discussed in several articles. In fact you briefly indicate what these 10 articles  have done, and explain what your own contribution will be. This section leads to your own model. In fact, the conclusion of section 1 contains all the major elements that your model will consist of. 

Section 2 The model, the hypotheses and the methodology. 
This section presents your theoretical model in the form of an equation. 
Explain each term and the predicted impact on the dependent variable. In some cases, you may have more than 1 model. 
Thereafter, you present your hypotheses which come out directly from your model.
Finally, you present the estimation method that you will use. For example, OLS;
or OLS with dummy variables; or pooled regression, etc… (This is usually justified by reference to some of the articles in your Review of the literature.)

Section 3 Data sources. An explanation of the data sources you will use. 
For each variable you have to provide the series that you will use and from what source.
(Give web link) This should done precisely.
It will not be acceptable to simply say the data will be from the World Bank and the OECD. 
You need to cite the relevant table and series. The detailed references for the data will be included in the bibliography.

Bibliography. It must be done according to the correct format for each type of reference. APA style. See posted reference documents. Chicago style will also be accepted. Each type of source (ex book, or web site) must be cited consistently in the same manner. 

There should be no page number for the title page. 
There should be page numbers starting with the introduction. 
The first page which contains the introduction after the title page is numbered 1. 
Page numbers in the bottom right-hand corner.

Sloppy work will not be accepted. The proposal must be neat, 
well organized, written in correct English and carefully proof-read. 
Points will be deducted for grammatical mistakes.

After submitting your proposal, you will receive comments with respect to how to modify and improve your proposal, 
and move to the next step, that is, the writing of the first draft.
